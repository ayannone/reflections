When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
==================
- to create a backup copy of my repository
- to share my work with other (developers)
- to collaborate on a project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
==================
because for example your local work might not be finished yet and you want to keep it in a logical unit without other code changes interfering with it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
==================
- forks are complete copies of repositories on GitHub directly made from a repo on GitHub; usage: i.e. to attain a copy of the code and make changes to it where I am NOT a contributor

- clones are complete copies of repos on local machines from local machines or from GitHub to a local machine; usage: i.e. to attain a copy of the code and make changes to it where I am a contributor

- branches are copies from a local repo made at a certain point of time; usage: to separate the development/work into independent versions, once the work is done the changes made on the branch can be merged into the master copy
